This repository contains the Angelscript code and GLSL shaders for Overgrowth, including every version from the earliest released alpha (a2) through the current public release.

This is the same code that shipped with each of these releases of the game and was extracted directly from the game install files.

I do not own this code, and no Wolfire employee checks this repo. This code is the property of Wolfire Games and I am posting it with the explicit written permission of David Rosen (CEO of Wolfire Games). The public availability of this code does NOT come with a license for you to use it for ANY purpose at all, besides those listed immediately below. You must ask David permission to use this in your own stuff.

If you're using this code as personal learning material (not as classroom material), or if you are using it for Overgrowth modding (whether making a mod, making free public tutorial vids, linking on the Wolfire official Wiki, etc), you're fine to use it for those things. For any other purpose, contact David Rosen at contact@wolfire.com
